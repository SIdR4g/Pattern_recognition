# Pattern_recognition
## Pattern recognition using Tensorflow and Keras by implementing Alexnet archtecture

## Running the notebook
Linux terminal / Windows cmd:-

 1. Install jupyter-notebook

```
$ pip install notebook
```
 2.Run jupyter-notebook server
```
$ jupyter-notebook
```
 3.Keep the Dataset.zip file and pattern_recognition.ipynb file in the same directory

 4.Open the .ipynb file from the notebook server and run each line in the given order
 
 ## Dataset
 
 The Dataset.zip file consists of a small collection of images belonging to 4 different classes. Here's a small sample of those shuffled images after Data Augmentation.

## Alexnet model and architecture

### Introduction:-

Alexnet won the Imagenet large-scale visual recognition challenge in 2012. The model was proposed in 2012 in the research paper named Imagenet Classification with Deep Convolution Neural Network by Alex Krizhevsky and his colleagues.In this model, the depth of the network was increased in comparison to Lenet-5.After competing in ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, AlexNet shot to fame. It achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%. This was 10.8% lower than that of runner up.
